# Documentation & comments

## Commenting guidelines
- Avoid inline comments in production code unless necessary.
- Inline comments are helpful in tests.
- When using TODO comments, follow the format on the [dedicated page][todo-comments].
- File and directory names should be formatted as code.

## Avoid widows, runts, orphans, or rivers

Agents should **AVOID** text flow patters illustrated
