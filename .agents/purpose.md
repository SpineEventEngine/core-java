# ðŸ§  Purpose

> **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**: This guide outlines how AI agents (ChatGPT, Codex, Junie, Claude, Gemini)
> collaborate on our Kotlin/Java project. It defines responsibilities, coding standards,
> and workflows to maintain high code quality and architectural integrity.

It outlines:

- Agent responsibilities (who does what).
- Coding and architectural guidelines agents must follow.
- Instructions for creating and testing agent-generated outputs.

Whether you are a developer, tester, or contributor, this guide helps you collaborate
with AI to maintain a high-quality codebase.

## Terminology
- **LLM**: Refers to the general category of language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, Junie).
- **Agents**: A broader term for LLMs collaborating on this project.
- Use specific names (**ChatGPT**, **Codex**) when they excel at different tasks
  (e.g., scaffolding versus explanation).
