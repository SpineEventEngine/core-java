/**
 * This script-plugin sets up Kotlin code analyzing with Detekt.
 *
 * After applying, Detekt is configured to use `${rootDir}/config/quality/detekt-config.yml` file.
 * Projects can append their own config files to override some parts of the default one or drop
 * it at all in a favor of their own one.
 *
 * An example of appending a custom config file to the default one:
 *
 * ```
 * detekt {
 *     config.from("config/detekt-custom-config.yml")
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To totally substitute it, just overwrite the corresponding property:
 *
 * ```
 * detekt {
 *     config = files("config/detekt-custom-config.yml")
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Also, it's possible to suppress Detekt findings using [baseline](https://detekt.dev/docs/introduction/baseline/)
 * file instead of suppressions in source code.
 *
 * An example of passing a baseline file:
 *
 * ```
 * detekt {
 *     baseline = file("config/detekt-baseline.yml")
 * }
 * ```
