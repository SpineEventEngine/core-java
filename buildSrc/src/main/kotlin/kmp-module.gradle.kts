/**
 * Configures this [Project] as a Kotlin Multiplatform module.
 *
 * By its nature, this script plugin is similar to `jvm-module`. It performs
 * the basic module configuration.
 *
 * `jvm-module` is based on a mix of Java and Kotlin Gradle plugins. It allows
 * usage of Kotlin and Java in a single module that is built for JVM.
 * Whereas `kmp-module` is based on a Kotlin Multiplatform plugin. This plugin
 * supports different compilation targets within a single module: JVM, IOS,
 * Desktop, JS, etc. Also, it allows having some common sources in Kotlin
 * that can be shared with target-specific code. They are located in
 * `commonMain` and `commonTest` source sets. Each concrete target implicitly
 * depends on them.
 *
 * As for now, this script configures only JVM target, but other targets
 * will be added further.
 *
 * ### JVM target
 *
 * Sources for this target are placed in `jvmMain` and `jvmTest` directories.
 * Java is allowed to be used in `jvm` sources, but Kotlin is a preference.
 * Use Java only as a fall-back option where Kotlin is insufficient.
 * Due to this, Java linters are not even configured by `kmp-module`.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html">Kotlin Multiplatform docs</a>
