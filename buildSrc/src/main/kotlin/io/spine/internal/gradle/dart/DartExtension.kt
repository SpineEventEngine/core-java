/**
 * Configures [DartExtension] that facilitates configuration of Gradle tasks and plugins
 * to build Dart projects.
 *
 * The whole structure of the extension looks as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * dart {
 *     environment {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     plugins {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     tasks {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Environment
 *
 * One of the main features of this extension is [DartEnvironment]. Environment describes a module
 * itself and used tools with their input/output files.
 *
 * The extension is shipped with a pre-configured environment. So, no pre-configuration is required.
 * Most properties in [DartEnvironment] have calculated defaults right in the interface.
 * Only two properties need explicit override.
 *
 * The extension defines them as follows:
 *
 *  1. [DartEnvironment.projectDir] –> `project.projectDir`.
 *  2. [DartEnvironment.projectName] —> `project.name`.
 *
 * There are two ways to modify the environment:
 *
 *  1. Modify [DartEnvironment] interface directly. Go with this option when it is a global change
 *     that should affect all projects which use this extension.
 *  2. Use [DartExtension.environment] scope — for temporary and custom overridings.
 *
 * An example of a property overriding:
 *
 * ```
 * dart {
 *     environment {
 *         integrationTestDir = projectDir.resolve("tests")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Please note, environment should be set up firstly to have the effect on the parts
 * of the extension that use it.
 *
 * ### Tasks and Plugins
 *
 * The spirit of tasks configuration in this extension is extracting the code that defines and
 * registers tasks into extension functions upon `DartTasks` in `buildSrc`. Those extensions should
 * be named after a task it registers or a task group if several tasks are registered at once.
 * Then this extension is called in a project's `build.gradle.kts`.
 *
 * `DartTasks` and `DartPlugins` scopes extend [DartContext] which provides access
 * to the current [DartEnvironment] and shortcuts for running `pub` tool.
 *
 * Below is the simplest example of how to create a primitive `printPubVersion` task.
 *
 * Firstly, a corresponding extension function should be defined in `buildSrc`:
 *
 * ```
 * fun DartTasks.printPubVersion() =
 *     register<Exec>("printPubVersion") {
 *         pub("--version")
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * Secondly, in a project's `build.gradle.kts` this extension is called:
 *
 * ```
 * dart {
 *     tasks {
 *         printPubVersion()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * An extension function is not restricted to register exactly one task. If several tasks can
 * be grouped into a logical bunch, they should be registered together:
 *
 * ```
 * fun DartTasks.build() {
 *     assembleDart()
 *     testDart()
 *     generateCoverageReport()
 * }
 *
 * private fun DartTasks.assembleDart() = ...
 *
 * private fun DartTasks.testDart() = ...
 *
 * private fun DartTasks.generateCoverageReport() = ...
 * ```
 *
 * This section is mostly dedicated to tasks. But tasks and plugins are configured
 * in a very similar way. So, everything above is also applicable to plugins. More detailed
 * guides can be found in docs to `DartTasks` and `DartPlugins`.
 *
 * @see [ConfigurableDartEnvironment]
 * @see [DartTasks]
 * @see [DartPlugins]
