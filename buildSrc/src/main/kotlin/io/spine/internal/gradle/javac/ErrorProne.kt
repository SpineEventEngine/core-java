 * Configures Error Prone for this `JavaCompile` task.

 * Specifies the arguments for the compiler invocations. In particular, this configuration
 * overrides a number of Error Prone defaults. See [ErrorProneConfig] for the details.
 *
 * Please note that while `ErrorProne` is a standalone Gradle plugin,
 * it still has to be configured through `JavaCompile` task options.
 *
 * Here's an example of how to use it:
 *
 * ```
 * tasks {
 *     withType<JavaCompile> {
 *         configureErrorProne()
 *     }
