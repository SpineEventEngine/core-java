/**
 * Configures `assembleJs` task and creates `copyBundledJs` task to work with `webpack` bundler.
 *
 * Please note, this task group depends on [assemble] and [publish] tasks. Therefore, those tasks
 * should be applied in the first place.
 *
 * In particular, this method:
 *
 *  1. Extends `assembleJs` task to bundle sources during assembling.
 *  2. Creates `copyBundledJs` task and binds it to `prepareJsPublication` task execution.
 *
 * Here's an example of how to apply it in `build.gradle.kts`:
 *
 * ```
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.javascript.javascript
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.javascript.task.assemble
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.javascript.task.publish
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.javascript.task.webpack
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * javascript {
 *     tasks {
 *         assemble()
 *         publish()
 *         webpack()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
