/**
 * Configures [JsExtension] that facilitates configuration of Gradle tasks and plugins
 * to build JavaScripts projects.
 *
 * The whole structure of the extension looks as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * javascript {
 *     environment {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     tasks {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     plugins {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Environment
 *
 * One of the main features of this extension is [JsEnvironment]. Environment describes a module
 * itself, used tools with their input/output files, code generation.
 *
 * The extension is shipped with a pre-configured environment. So, no pre-configuration is required.
 * Most properties in [JsEnvironment] have calculated defaults right in the interface.
 * Only two properties need explicit override.
 *
 * The extension defines them as follows:
 *
 *  1. [JsEnvironment.projectDir] –> `project.projectDir`.
 *  2. [JsEnvironment.moduleVersion] —> `project.extra["versionToPublishJs"]`.
 *
 * There are two ways to modify the environment:
 *
 *  1. Update [JsEnvironment] directly. Go with this option when it is a global change
 *     that should affect all projects which use this extension.
 *  2. Use [JsExtension.environment] scope — for temporary and custom overridings.
 *
 * An example of a property overriding:
 *
 * ```
 * javascript {
 *     environment {
 *         moduleVersion = "$moduleVersion-SPECIAL_EDITION"
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Please note, environment should be set up firstly to have the effect on the parts
 * of the extension that use it.
 *
 * ### Tasks and Plugins
 *
 * The spirit of tasks configuration in this extension is extracting the code that defines and
 * registers tasks into extension functions upon `JsTasks` in `buildSrc`. Those extensions should be
 * named after a task it registers or a task group if several tasks are registered at once.
 * Then this extension is called in a project's `build.gradle.kts`.
 *
 * `JsTasks` and `JsPlugins` scopes extend [JsContext] which provides access
 * to the current [JsEnvironment] and shortcuts for running `npm` tool.
 *
 * Below is the simplest example of how to create a primitive `printNpmVersion` task.
 *
 * Firstly, a corresponding extension function should be defined in `buildSrc`:
 *
 * ```
 * fun JsTasks.printNpmVersion() =
 *     register("printNpmVersion") {
 *         doLast {
 *             npm("--version")
 *         }
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * Secondly, in a project's `build.gradle.kts` this extension is called:
 *
 * ```
 * javascript {
 *     tasks {
 *         printNpmVersion()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * An extension function is not restricted to register exactly one task. If several tasks can
 * be grouped into a logical bunch, they should be registered together:
 *
 * ```
 * fun JsTasks.build() {
 *     assembleJs()
 *     testJs()
 *     generateCoverageReport()
 * }
 *
 * private fun JsTasks.assembleJs() = ...
 *
 * private fun JsTasks.testJs() = ...
 *
 * private fun JsTasks.generateCoverageReport() = ...
 * ```
 *
 * This section is mostly dedicated to tasks. But tasks and plugins are configured
 * in a very similar way. So, everything above is also applicable to plugins. More detailed
 * guides can be found in docs to `JsTasks` and `JsPlugins`.
 *
 * @see [ConfigurableJsEnvironment]
 * @see [JsTasks]
 * @see [JsPlugins]
