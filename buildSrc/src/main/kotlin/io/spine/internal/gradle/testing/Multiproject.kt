/**
 * Exposes the test classes of this project as a new "testArtifacts" configuration.
 *
 * This allows other projects to depend on the test classes from this project within a Gradle
 * multi-project build. It is helpful in case the dependant projects re-use abstract test suites
 * of some "parent" project.
 *
 * Please note that this utility requires Gradle `java` plugin to be applied. Hence, it is
 * recommended to call this extension method from `java` scope.
 *
 * Here's an example of how to expose the test classes of "projectA":
 *
 * ```
 * java {
 *     exposeTestConfiguration()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Here's an example of how to consume the exposed classes in "projectB":
 *
 * ```
 * dependencies {
 *     testImplementation(project(path = ":projectA", configuration = "testArtifacts"))
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Don't forget that this exposure mechanism works only for projects that reside within the same
 * multi-project build. In order to share the test classes with external projects, publish a
 * dedicated [testJar][io.spine.internal.gradle.publish.SpinePublishing.testJar] artifact.
