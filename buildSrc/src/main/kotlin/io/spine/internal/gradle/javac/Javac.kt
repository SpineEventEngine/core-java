/**
 * Configures the `javac` tool through this `JavaCompile` task.

 * The following steps are performed:
 *
 *  1. Passes a couple of arguments to the compiler. See [JavacConfig] for more details;
 *  2. Sets the UTF-8 encoding to be used when reading Java source files.
 *
 * Here's an example of how to use it:
 *
 *```

 *         configureJavac()
