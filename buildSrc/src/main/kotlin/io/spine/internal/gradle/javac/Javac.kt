 * Sets up `javac` by applying [JavacConfig].

 *
 *  1. Ensuring JDK 8 would be used for compilation;
 *  2. Specifying arguments for `javac` invocations;
 *  3. Specifying the `UTF-8` encoding to be used when reading source files.

 * Supporting other JDKs
 *
 * `Spine Event Engine` can be built with JDK 8 only. Supporting JDK 11 and above

 *     }
