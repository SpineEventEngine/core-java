/**
 * A scope for applying and configuring Dart-related plugins.
 *
 * The scope extends [DartContext] and provides shortcuts for key project's containers:
 *
 *  1. [plugins].
 *  2. [extensions].
 *  3. [tasks].
 *
 * Let's imagine one wants to apply and configure `FooBar` plugin. To do that, several steps
 * should be completed:
 *
 *  1. Declare the corresponding extension function upon [DartContext] named after the plugin.
 *  2. Apply and configure the plugin inside that function.
 *  3. Call the resulted extension in your `build.gradle.kts` file.
 *
 * Here's an example of `dart/plugin/FooBar.kt`:
 *
 * ```
 * fun DartPlugins.fooBar() {
 *     plugins.apply("com.fooBar")
 *     extensions.configure<FooBarExtension> {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And here's how to apply it in `build.gradle.kts`:
 *
 *  ```
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.dart.dart
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.dart.plugins.fooBar
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * dart {
 *     plugins {
 *         fooBar()
 *     }
 * }
 *  ```
