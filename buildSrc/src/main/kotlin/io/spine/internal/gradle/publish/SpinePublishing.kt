/**
 * Configures [SpinePublishing] extension.
 *
 * This extension sets up publishing of artifacts to Maven repositories.
 *
 * The extension can be configured for single- and multi-module projects.
 *
 * When used with a multi-module project, the extension should be opened in a root project's
 * build file. The published modules are specified explicitly by their names:
 *
 * ```
 * spinePublishing {
 *     modules = setOf(
 *         "subprojectA",
 *         "subprojectB",
 *     )
 *     destinations = setOf(
 *         PublishingRepos.cloudRepo,
 *         PublishingRepos.cloudArtifactRegistry,
 *     )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When used with a single-module project, the extension should be opened in a project's build file.
 * Only destinations should be specified:
 *
 * ```
 * spinePublishing {
 *     destinations = setOf(
 *         PublishingRepos.cloudRepo,
 *         PublishingRepos.cloudArtifactRegistry,
 *     )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * It is worth to mention, that publishing of a module can be configured only from a single place.
 * For example, declaring `subprojectA` as published in a root project and opening
 * `spinePublishing` extension within `subprojectA` itself would lead to an exception.
 *
 * In Gradle, in order to publish something somewhere one should create a publication. In each
 * of published modules, the extension will create a [publication][MavenJavaPublication]
 * named "mavenJava". All artifacts, published by this extension belong to this publication.
 *
 * By default, along with the compilation output of "main" source set, the extension publishes
 * the following artifacts:
 *
 * 1. [sourcesJar] – sources from "main" source set. Includes "hand-made" Java,
 *    Kotlin and Proto files. In order to include the generated code into this artifact, a module
 *    should specify those files as a part of "main" source set.
 *
 *    Here's an example of how to do that:
 *
 *    ```
 *    sourceSets {
 *        val generatedDir by extra("$projectDir/generated")
 *        val generatedSpineDir by extra("$generatedDir/main/java")
 *        main {
 *            java.srcDir(generatedSpineDir)
 *        }
 *    }
 *    ```
 * 2. [protoJar] – only Proto sources from "main" source set. It's published only if
 *   Proto files are actually present in the source set. Publication of this artifact is optional
 *   and can be disabled via [SpinePublishing.protoJar].
 * 3. [javadocJar] - javadoc, generated upon Java sources from "main" source set.
 *   If javadoc for Kotlin is also needed, apply Dokka plugin. It tunes `javadoc` task to generate
 *   docs upon Kotlin sources as well.
 *
 * Additionally, [testJar] artifact can be published. This artifact contains compilation output
 * of "test" source set. Use [SpinePublishing.testJar] to enable its publishing.
 *
 * @see [registerArtifacts]
