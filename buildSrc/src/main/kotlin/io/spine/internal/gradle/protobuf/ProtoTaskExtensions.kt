/**
 * Configures protobuf code generation task for the code which cannot use Spine Model Compiler
 * (e.g. the `base` project).
 *
 * The task configuration consists of the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Generation of descriptor set file is turned on for each source set.
 *    These files are placed under the `build/descriptors` directory.
 *
 * 2. At the final steps of the code generation, the code belonging to
 *    the `com.google` package is removed.
 *
 * 3. Make `processResource` tasks depend on corresponding `generateProto` tasks.
 *    If the source set of the configured task isn't `main`, appropriate infix for
 *    the task names is used.
 *
 * The usage of this extension in a <em>module build file</em> would be:
 * ```
 *  val generatedDir by extra("$projectDir/generated")
 *  protobuf {
 *      generateProtoTasks {
 *         for (task in all()) {
 *            task.setup(generatedDir)
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * Using the same code under `subprojects` in a root build file does not seem to work because
 * test descriptor set files are not copied to resources. Performing this configuration from
 * subprojects solves the issue.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In addition to calling `setup`, a submodule must contain a descriptor set reference
 * file (`desc.ref`) files placed under `resources`. The descriptor reference file must contain
 * a reference to the descriptor set file generated by the corresponding `GenerateProtoTask`.
 *
 * For example, for the `test` source set, the reference would be `known_types_test.desc`, and
 * for the `main` source set, the reference would be `known_types_main.desc`.
 *
 * See `io.spine.code.proto.DescriptorReference` and `io.spine.code.proto.FileDescriptors` classes
 * under the `base` project for more details.
