/**
 * Configures logging of this [Test] task.
 *
 * Enables logging of:
 *  1. Standard `out` and `err` streams;
 *  2. Thrown exceptions.
 *
 *  Additionally, after all the tests are executed, a short summary would be logged. The summary
 *  consists of the number of tests and their results.
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 *```
 * tasks {
 *     withType<Test> {
 *         configureLogging()
 *     }
