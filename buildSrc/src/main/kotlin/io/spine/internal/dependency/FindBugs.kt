/**
 * The FindBugs project is dead since 2017. It has a successor called SpotBugs, but we don't use it.
 * We use ErrorProne for static analysis instead. The only reason for having this dependency is
 * the annotations for null-checking introduced by JSR-305. These annotations are troublesome,
 * but no alternatives are known for some of them so far.  Please see
 * [this issue](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/base/issues/108) for more details.
