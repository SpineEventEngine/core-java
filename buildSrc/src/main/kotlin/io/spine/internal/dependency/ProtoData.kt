/**
 * Dependencies on ProtoData modules.
 *
 * To use a locally published ProtoData version instead of the version from a public plugin
 * registry, set the `PROTODATA_VERSION` and/or the `PROTODATA_DF_VERSION` environment variables
 * and stop the Gradle daemons so that Gradle observes the env change:
 * ```
 * export PROTODATA_VERSION=0.43.0-local
 * export PROTODATA_DF_VERSION=0.41.0
 *
 * ./gradle --stop
 * ./gradle build   # Conduct the intended checks.
 * ```
 *
 * Then, to reset the console to run the usual versions again, remove the values of
 * the environment variables and stop the daemon:
 * ```
 * export PROTODATA_VERSION=""
 * export PROTODATA_DF_VERSION=""
 *
 * ./gradle --stop
 * ```
 *
