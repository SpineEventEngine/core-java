/**
 * Configures [SpinePublishing] extension.
 *
 * This extension sets up publishing of artifacts to Maven repositories.
 *
 * The extension can be configured for single- and multi-module projects.
 *
 * ## Using in a multi-module project
 *
 * When used with a multi-module project, the extension should be opened in a root project's
 * build file. The published modules are specified explicitly by their names:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * spinePublishing {
 *     modules = setOf(
 *         "subprojectA",
 *         "subprojectB",
 *     )
 *     destinations = PublishingRepos.run { setOf(
 *         cloudArtifactRegistry,
 *         gitHub("<ProjectRepo>")  // The name of the GitHub repository of the project.
 *     )}
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Filtering out test-only modules
 *
 * Sometimes a functional or an integration test requires a significant amount of
 * configuration code which is better understood when isolated into a separate module.
 * Conventionally, we use the `-tests` suffix for naming such modules.
 *
 * In order to avoid publishing of such a test-only module, we use the following extensions
 * for the Gradle [Project] class: [productionModules], [productionModuleNames].
 * So the above code for specifying the modules to publish could be rewritten as follows:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * spinePublishing {
 *     modules = productionModuleNames.toSet()
 * }
 * ```
 * This code works for most of the projects.
 *
 * ### Arranging custom publishing for a module
 * ```kotlin
 *
 * 1. Modify the list of standardly published modules in the root project like this:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * spinePublishing {
 *     modules = productionModuleNames
 *       .minus("my-custom-module")
 *       .toSet()
 *
 *     modulesWithCustomPublishing = setOf(
 *         "my-custom-module"
 *     )
 *
 *     // ...
 * }
 * ```
 * 2. Arrange the custom publishing in the `my-custom-module` project.
 *
 * ## Using in a single-module project
 *
 * When used with a single-module project, the extension should be opened in a project's build file.
 * Only destinations should be specified:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * spinePublishing {
 *     destinations = PublishingRepos.run { setOf(
 *         cloudArtifactRegistry,
 *         gitHub("<ProjectRepo>")
 *     )}
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Publishing modules
 *
 * It is worth mentioning that publishing of a module can be configured only from a single place.
 * For example, declaring `subprojectA` as published in a root project and opening
 * `spinePublishing` extension within `subprojectA` itself would lead to an exception.
 *
 * In Gradle, in order to publish something somewhere, one should create a publication. In each
 * of published modules, the extension will create a [publication][StandardJavaPublicationHandler]
 * named "mavenJava". All artifacts published by this extension belong to this publication.
 *
 * ## Published artifacts
 *
 * By default, along with the compilation output of the `main` source set, the extension publishes
 * the following artifacts:
 *
 * 1. [sourcesJar] — sources from the `main` source set. Includes handcrafted and generated
 *    code in Java, Kotlin, and `.proto` files.
 *
 * 2. [protoJar] – only `.proto` sources from the `main` source set. It's published only if
 *   Proto files are actually present in the source set. Publication of this artifact is optional
 *   and can be disabled via [SpinePublishing.protoJar].
 *
 * 3. [javadocJar] — Javadoc, generated upon Java sources from the `main` source set.
 *   If Javadoc for Kotlin is also needed, apply the Dokka plugin.
 *   It tunes the `javadoc` task to generate docs upon Kotlin sources as well.
 *
 * 4. [dokkaKotlinJar] — documentation generated by Dokka for Kotlin and Java sources
 *   using the Kotlin API mode.
 *
 * 5. [dokkaJavaJar] — documentation generated by Dokka for Kotlin and Java sources
 *   using the Java API mode.
 *
 * Additionally, [testJar] artifact can be published. This artifact contains compilation output
 * of the `test` source set. Use [SpinePublishing.testJar] to enable its publishing.
 *
 * @see [artifacts]
 * @see SpinePublishing
