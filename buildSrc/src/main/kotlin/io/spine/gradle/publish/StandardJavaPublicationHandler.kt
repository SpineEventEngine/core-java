/**
 * A publication for a typical Java project.

 * A publication has a name and consists of one or more artifacts plus information about
 * those artifacts – the metadata.
 *
 * An instance of this class represents
 * [MavenPublication][org.gradle.api.publish.maven.MavenPublication]
 * named [`"mavenJava"`][PUBLICATION_NAME].
 * It is generally accepted that a publication with this name contains a Java project
 * published to one or more Maven repositories.
 *
 * By default, only a jar with the compilation output of `main` source set and its
 * metadata files are published. Other artifacts are specified through the
 * [constructor parameter][jarFlags].
 * Please take a look on [specifyArtifacts] for additional info.
 *
 * @param jarFlags The flags for additional JARs published along with the compilation output.
 * @param destinations Maven repositories to which the produced artifacts will be sent.
