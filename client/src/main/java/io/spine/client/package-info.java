/**
 * This package provides classes and interfaces for performing client requests like
 * posting commands, running queries, or creating subscriptions.
 *
 * <p>The term <em>actor</em> used in this API means the user on behalf of whom requests
 * are created and executed. The package provides two levels of API.
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><strong>High-level {@link io.spine.client.Client} API</strong></dt>
 *   <dd>is meant for client-side Java applications that would communicate with backend
 *   services via a gRPC connection. An instance of the {@link io.spine.client.Client} class
 *   establishes this connection and serves as a fluent API gateway for composing and posting
 *   requests.
 *   </dd>
 *
 *   <dt><strong>Low-level {@link io.spine.client.ActorRequestFactory} API</strong></dt>
 *   <dd>is meant for server-side code which needs to speak to backend services without involving
 *   gRPC. This API is also by the High-level API implementation.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>The {@link io.spine.client.Filters} utility class provides methods for composing filtering
 * conditions for both levels of the API.
 *
 * <p>When subscribing the Client API accepts an implementation of a functional interface
 * (see {@link io.spine.client.StateConsumer} and {@link io.spine.client.EventConsumer}).
 * Errors occurred when streaming or consuming messages are handled via
 * {@link io.spine.client.ErrorHandler} and {@link io.spine.client.ConsumerErrorHandler}
 * correspondingly.
