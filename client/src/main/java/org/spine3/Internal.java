/**
 * Annotates a program element (class, method, package etc.) which is internal to Spine,
 * not part of the public API, and should not be used by users of the framework.
 *
 * <p>If you plan to implement an extension of the framework, which is going to be
 * wired into the framework, you may use the internal parts. Please consult with the Spine
 * team, as the internal APIs do not have the same stability API guarantee as public ones.
 *
 * <p>See {@link SPI} annotation if you plan to write an extension of the framework.
