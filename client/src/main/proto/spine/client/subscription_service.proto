// A service for subscribing to receive updates by a specified topic.
//
// The subscription topic define a type in updates of which the client code is interested in, and
// filtering conditions (e.g. by values of fields or identity).
//
// Creating a subscriptions consists of two steps:
//  * Step 1: creating `Subscription` instance. This steps verifies that type specified in
//    the `Topic` is available at the server, and prepares backend structures for delivering
//    updates. Subscription is created by the `Subscribe(Topic)` call.
//    together with the contexts of the events.
//
//  * Step 2: activating the subscription. This step turns the subscription on.
//    Activation is performed by the `Activate(Subscription)` call.
//
// The client will receive updates until the subscription is cancelled via `Cancel(Subscription)`.

    // in run-time error.

    // please call `Subscribe(Topic)` and then `Activate(Subscription)` again.
