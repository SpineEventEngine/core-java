/**
 * Filters events delivered to a handler method.
 *
 * To apply filtering to a handler method, annotate the first parameter of the method.
 *
 * For example, the following method would be invoked only if the owner of
 * the project is `admin@ackme.net`:
 * ```
 *   @React
 *   ProjectDeletedForever on(@Where(field = "owner.email", equals = "admin@ackme.net")
 *                            ProjectRanOutOfMoney e) {
 *       ...
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * # Filtering Events by a Field Value
 *
 * If a field filter is defined, only the events matching this filter are passed to the handler
 * method.
 *
 * Only methods which accept an event may add filters. Entity subscribers cannot use this kind of
 * filtering, neither can methods that receive a command. Declaring a `@Where` filter on a parameter
 * of such a method will cause a runtime error. See the annotation [AcceptsFilters] for more info
 * on which methods can have a filer.
 *
 * A single class may define a number of handler methods with different field filters. Though,
 * all the field filters must target the same field. For example, this setup is valid:
 * ```
 *   @React
 *   SubscriptionEnded onExpired(@Where(field = "subscription.status", equals = "EXPIRED")
 *                               UserLoggedIn event) {
 *       // Handle expired subscription.
 *   }
 *
 *   @React
 *   FreeUserLoggedIn onInactive(@Where(field = "subscription.status", equals = "INACTIVE")
 *                               UserLoggedIn event) {
 *      // Handle inactive subscription.
 *   }
 *
 *   @React
 *   Optional<PayingUserLoggedIn> on(UserLoggedIn event) {
 *      // Handle other cases.
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * And this one is not:
 * ```
 *   @Subscribe
 *   void onExpired(@Where(field = "subscription.status", equals = "EXPIRED")
 *                  UserLoggedIn event) {
 *      ...
 *   }
 *
 *   @Subscribe
 *   void onUnknownBilling(@Where(field = "payment_method.status", equals = "UNSET")
 *                         UserLoggedIn event) {
 *       // Error, different field paths used in the same class for the same event type.
 *   }
 * ```
