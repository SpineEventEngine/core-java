// `Event` is something, which happened in the past.
//
// An event consists of two parts: event message and its context.
//
// The `message` is the domain model part of the event.
// Event messages are named in the past tense.
//
// The type of the event is defined by the type of the enclosed message.
// When we speak about an 'event' as a typed thing, we refer to the message of the event.
//
// An event subscriber uses the type of the event message to receive events of this type.
//
// There can be multiple subscribers per event type.
//
// The event context contains attributes common for all events.
// It can also contain additional attributes added by the code handling the event.
