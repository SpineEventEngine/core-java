/**
 * Marks a method as a subscriber for the command output.
 *
 * <p>Use it to subscribe to either events or business rejections
 *
 * <h2>Subscribing to Events</h2>
 *
 * <p>An event subscriber method:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>is annotated with {@link Subscribe};
 *     <li>is {@code public};
 *     <li>returns {@code void};
 *     <li>accepts an event derived from {@link com.google.protobuf.Message Message}
 *          as the first parameter;
 *     <li>(optional) accepts an {@link io.spine.core.EventContext EventContext}
 *          as the second parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Subscribing to Rejections</h2>
 *
 * <p>A rejection subscriber method:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>is annotated with {@link Subscribe};
 *     <li>is {@code public};
 *     <li>returns {@code void};
 *     <li>accepts a rejection message derived from {@link com.google.protobuf.Message Message}
 *          as the first parameter;
 *     <li>(optional) accepts a command derived from {@link com.google.protobuf.Message Message}
 *          as the second parameter;
 *     <li>(optional) accepts an {@link io.spine.core.CommandContext CommandContext}
 *          as the second or the third parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Therefore, if the subscriber method specifies both the command message and
 * the command context, it must have the parameters exactly is that order, i.e.
 * {@code (RejectionMessage, CommandMessage, CommandContext)}. Otherwise, an exception may be thrown
 * at runtime.
 *
 * <p>The type of the command argument, if specified, acts as a filter, i.e. the subscriber receives
 * the rejection if:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the rejection type matches the first argument type;
 *     <li>the command, which processing caused the rejection, has the same type as
 *         the command message argument if it is present;
 *     <li>if the command message argument is absent, any rejection of a matching type is received
 *         by the subscriber.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If the annotation is applied to a method which doesn't satisfy any of these requirements,
 * this method is not considered as a subscriber and is not registered for the command output
 * delivery.
