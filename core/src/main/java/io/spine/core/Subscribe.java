/**
 * Marks a method as a subscriber for the command output.
 *
 * <p>Use it to subscribe to either events, business rejections, or entity state updates.
 *
 * <h1>Subscribing to Events</h1>
 *
 * <p>An event subscriber method:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>is annotated with {@link Subscribe};
 *     <li>returns {@code void};
 *     <li>accepts an event derived from {@link io.spine.base.EventMessage EventMessage}
 *          as the first parameter;
 *     <li>(optional) accepts an {@link io.spine.core.EventContext EventContext}
 *          as the second parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>Subscribing to Rejections</h1>
 *
 * <p>A rejection subscriber method:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>is annotated with {@link Subscribe};
 *     <li>returns {@code void};
 *     <li>accepts a rejection message derived from {@link io.spine.base.RejectionMessage
 *         RejectionMessage} as the first parameter;
 *     <li>(optional) accepts a command derived from {@link io.spine.base.CommandMessage
 *         CommandMessage} as the second parameter;
 *     <li>(optional) accepts an {@link io.spine.core.CommandContext CommandContext}
 *          as the second or the third parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Therefore, if the subscriber method specifies both the command message and
 * the command context, it must have the parameters exactly is that order, i.e.
 * {@code (RejectionMessage, CommandMessage, CommandContext)}. Otherwise, an exception may be thrown
 * at runtime.
 *
 * <p>The type of the command argument, if specified, acts as a filter, i.e. the subscriber receives
 * the rejection if:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the rejection type matches the first argument type;
 *     <li>the command, which processing caused the rejection, has the same type as
 *         the command message argument if it is present;
 *     <li>if the command message argument is absent, any rejection of a matching type is received
 *         by the subscriber.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>Subscribing to Entity State Updates</h1>
 *
 * <p>An entity state subscriber method:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>is annotated with {@link Subscribe};
 *     <li>returns {@code void};
 *     <li>accepts an entity state message marked with the {@code (entity)} option as the only
 *         parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If the annotation is applied to a method which doesn't satisfy either of these requirements,
 * this method is not considered a subscriber and is not registered for the command output delivery.
 *
 * <p>Event subscriber methods are designed to be called by the framework only.
 * Therefore, it is recommended to declare a them as package-private.
 * It discourages a developer from calling these methods directly from anywhere.
 *
 * <p>Package-private access level still declares that an event reactor method is a part
 * of the Bounded Context-level API. See the {@link io.spine.core.BoundedContext
 * BoundedContext} description on how the packages and Bounded Contexts relate.
 *
 * <p>When subscribing to events, {@linkplain Where field filtering} is supported.
