/**
 * Marks a package as one belonging to a Bounded Context with
 * the {@linkplain #value() specified name}.
 *
 * <p>Java does not have the notion of package nesting. Packages in Java are separated namespaces
 * which seem to have a hierarchical structure for convenience.
 *
 * <h1>Nesting Convention</h1>
 * <p>This annotation assumes that nesting formed by a programmer when naming packages <em>is</em>
 * a hierarchy. Terms mentioned below assume that package “inheritance” or “hierarchy” is a
 * convention supported by this framework and is not a standard feature of Java.
 *
 * <h1>Inheriting Package Annotation</h1>
 * <p>Packages which names start with the name of the annotated package “inherit” the annotation.
 * This means that these packages belong to the same Bounded Context <em>unless</em> they are
 * annotated with another Bounded Context name.
 *
 * <p>A possible usage scenario would be to have an aggregate root class placed in a “parent”
 * package, and aggregate parts being under “sub-packages”.
 *
 * <p>Packages that do not have a common “parent” but annotated with the same name belong
 * to the same Bounded Context.
