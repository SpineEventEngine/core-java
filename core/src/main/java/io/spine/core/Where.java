/**
 * Filters events delivered to a handler method.
 *
 * <p>To apply filtering to an event handler method, annotate the first parameter of the method.
 *
 * <p>For example, the following method would be invoked only if the owner of the created
 * project is {@code mary@ackme.net}:
 * <pre>
 *{@literal @Subscribe }
 * void on(@Where(field = "owner.email", equals = "mary@ackme.net") ProjectCreated e) { ... }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Annotations for handler methods which support {@code @Where} should be marked with
 * {@link AcceptsFilters}.
 *
 * <h1>Filtering Events by a Field Value</h1>
 * <p>If a field filter is defined, only the events matching this filter are passed to the handler
 * method.
 *
 * <p>A single class may define a number of handler methods with different field filters. Though,
 * all the field filters must target the same field. For example, this event handling is valid:
 * <pre>
 *    {@literal @Subscribe}
 *     void{@literal onExpired(@Where(field = "subscription.status", equals = "EXPIRED")
 *                      UserLoggedIn event)} {
 *         // Handle expired subscription.
 *     }
 *
 *    {@literal @Subscribe}
 *     void{@literal onInactive(@Where(field = "subscription.status", equals = "INACTIVE")
 *                       UserLoggedIn event)} {
 *         // Handle inactive subscription.
 *     }
 *
 *    {@literal @Subscribe}
 *     void on(UserLoggedIn event) {
 *         // Handle other cases.
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>And this one is not:
 * <pre>
 *    {@literal @Subscribe}
 *     void{@literal onExpired(@Where(field = "subscription.status", equals = "EXPIRED")
 *                      UserLoggedIn event)} {
 *     }
 *
 *    {@literal @Subscribe}
 *     void{@literal onUnknownBilling(@Where(field = "payment_method.status", equals = "UNSET")
 *                             UserLoggedIn event)} {
 *         // Error, different field paths used in the same class for the same event type.
 *     }
 * </pre>
