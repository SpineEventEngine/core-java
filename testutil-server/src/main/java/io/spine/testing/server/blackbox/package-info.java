/**
 * This package provides test utilities for implementing black box server testing.

 * 
 * <p>One such black box example is for {@link io.spine.testing.server.blackbox.BlackBoxContext
 * Bounded Context testing}. It allows sending Commands and Events to the 
 * {@link io.spine.server.BoundedContext Bounded Context} and then verifying their effect 
 * inside of the Bounded Context.
