Spine Event Engine is a Java framework for building Event Sourcing and CQRS applications that are 
accessed by clients built with JavaScript, Java Nano (Android), Dart, and Java.

Requires Java 8 or higher.

Gradle is used as a build and dependency management system. 

## Releases
The project is under active ongoing development. You are welcome to experiment and [provide your feedback][email-developers].

The latest stable version is [1.5.0][latest-release].  

## Quickstart and Examples

There is a [template][server-quickstart] for a server application built in Spine. 

To add Spine into an existing project consider using [Spine Bootstrap Gradle plugin](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/bootstrap/).

The introductory application examples are available from the [Spine Examples][spine-examples] GitHub organization.

For more advanced example including a Spine server, a console client, and a web application, see [ToDo List app][todo-list].

## Building from Sources

Building Spine modules and libraries requires JDK 8. 

The support of JDK 11 is planned for v3 of the framework.

## Important Warnings
* The code annotated with `@Internal` are not parts of public API of the framework, therefore should
not be used from outside of the framework.
* The public API marked as `@Experimental` may be used at own risk; it can change at any time, 
and has no guarantee of API stability or backward-compatibility.
* The API annotated with `@SPI` is for those who intend to extend the framework, 
or provide custom storage implementations. 

If you need to use API with one of these annotations, please [contact us][email-developers].
