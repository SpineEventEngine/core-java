[Spine Event Engine][spine-site] is a Java framework for building Event Sourcing and CQRS
applications that are accessed by clients built with JavaScript, Java Nano (Android), Dart, and Java.

This repository contains the code of:
 - core types;
 - client API;
 - server API;
 - testing utilities for the client- and server-side code.

## Releases

The project is under active ongoing development. 
You are welcome to experiment and [provide your feedback][email-developers].

The latest stable version is [1.5.0][latest-release].  

## Quick start and examples

Please see the [“Quick Start” guide][quick-start] which goes through a Hello World project showing
how to create a Spine-based project.
 
More introductory application examples are available from
the [Spine Examples][spine-examples] GitHub organization.

## Building from sources

Building Spine modules and libraries requires JDK 8. 

The support of JDK 11 is planned for the [version 2.0.0][v2] of the framework.

Gradle is used as a build and dependency management system.

## Important warnings
* The code annotated with `@Internal` are not parts of public API of the framework, therefore should
  not be used from outside of the framework.

* The public API marked as `@Experimental` may be used at own risk; it can change at any time, 
  and has no guarantee of API stability or backward-compatibility.

* The API annotated with `@SPI` is for those who intend to extend the framework, 
  or provide custom storage implementations. 

If you need to use API with one of these annotations, please [contact us][email-developers].
