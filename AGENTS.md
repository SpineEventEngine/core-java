*Note: The diagram shows the typical workflow and which agent to use for different task types.*


### Tagging pull request messages

Use PR tags for clarity:
```text
feat(chatgpt): Updated README with clearer KDoc examples
fix(codex): Completed missing `when` branches in tests
perf(gpt-4o): Optimized event processing pipeline
```
#### Why tag pull requests?
Tagging PRs helps the team:
  - Track which agent contributed to specific changes.
  - Understand whether a PR needs extra human review based on the agent's role.
  - Make decisions about multi-agent collaboration in reviews.

## üßæ Coding guidelines for Agents

### Core principles

- Adhere to [Spine Event Engine Documentation][spine-docs] for coding style.
- Generate code that compiles cleanly and passes static analysis.
- Respect existing architecture, naming conventions, and project structure.
- Write clear, incremental commits with descriptive messages.
- Include automated tests for any code change that alters functionality.

### Kotlin best practices

#### ‚úÖ Prefer
- **Kotlin idioms** over Java-style approaches:
  - Extension functions
  - `when` expressions 
  - Smart casts
  - Data classes and sealed classes
  - Immutable data structures
- **Simple nouns** over composite nouns (`user` > `userAccount`)  
- **Generic parameters** over explicit variable types (`val list = mutableList<Dependency>()`)  
- **Java interop annotations** only when needed (`@file:JvmName`, `@JvmStatic`)
- **Kotlin DSL** for Gradle files

#### ‚ùå Avoid
- Mutable data structures
- Java-style verbosity (builders with setters)
- Redundant null checks (`?.let` misuse)
- Using `!!` unless clearly justified
- Type names in variable names (`userObject`, `itemList`)
- String duplication (use constants in companion objects)
- Mixing Groovy and Kotlin DSLs in build logic
- Reflection unless specifically requested

### Documentation & comments

#### KDoc style
- Write concise descriptions for all public and internal APIs.
- Start parameter descriptions with capital letters.
- End parameter descriptions with commas.
- Use inline code with backticks for code references (`example`).
- Format code blocks with fences and language identifiers:
  ```kotlin
  // Example code
  fun example() {
      // Implementation
  }
  ```

#### Commenting guidelines
- Avoid inline comments in production code unless necessary.
- Inline comments are helpful in tests.
- When using TODO comments, follow the format on [dedicated page][todo-comments].
- File and directory names should be formatted as code.

#### Tex width
- Wrap `.md` text to 80 characters for readability.
- Wrap KDoc comments at 75 characters. 

#### Using periods
- Use periods at the end of complete sentences.
- Use no periods for short bullets.
- Use periods for full or multi-clause bullets.
- Use no periods for fragments.
- Be consistent within the list!

### Text formatting
 - ‚úÖ Remove double empty lines in the code.
 - ‚úÖ Remove trailing space characters in the code.

---

## Safety rules

- ‚úÖ All code must compile and pass static analysis.
- ‚úÖ Do not auto-update external dependencies.
- ‚ùå Never use reflection or unsafe code without explicit approval.
- ‚ùå No analytics or telemetry code.
- ‚ùå No blocking calls inside coroutines.

---

## Version policy

<details>
<summary>Click to expand versioning guidelines</summary>

### We use semver
The version of the project is kept in the `version.gradle.kts` file in the root of the project.

The version numbers in these files follow the conventions of
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

### Quick checklist for versioning
1. Increment the patch version in `version.gradle.kts`.
   Retain zero-padding if applicable:
    - Example: `"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.009"` ‚Üí `"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.010"`
2. Commit the version bump separately with this comment:
   ```text
   Bump version ‚Üí `$newVersion`
   ``` 
3. Rebuild using `./gradlew clean build`.
4. Update `pom.xml`, `dependencies.md` and commit changes with: `Update dependency reports`

Remember: PRs without version bumps will fail CI (conflict resolution detailed above).

### Resolving conflicts in `version.gradle.kts`
A branch conflict over the version number should be resolved as described below.
 * If a merged branch has a number which is less than that of the current branch, the version of
   the current branch stays.
 * If the merged branch has the number which is greater or equal to that of the current branch,
   the number should be increased by one.

### When to bump the version?
 - When a new branch is created.

## üí¨ Interaction tips ‚Äì key to effective collaboration!

<details>
<summary>Click to expand collaboration guidelines</summary>

- Human programmers may use inline comments to guide agents:
  ```kotlin
    // ChatGPT: Suggest a refactor for better readability.
    // Codex: Complete the missing branches in this `when` block.
    // ChatGPT: explain this logic.
    // Codex: complete this function.
   ```
- Agents should ensure pull request messages are concise and descriptive:
  ```text
  feat(chatgpt): suggested DSL refactoring for query handlers  
  fix(codex): completed missing case in sealed class hierarchy
  ```
- Encourage `// TODO:` or `// FIXME:` comments to be clarified by ChatGPT.

- When agents or humans add TODO comments, they **must** follow the format described on
  the [dedicated page][todo-comments].

</details>
