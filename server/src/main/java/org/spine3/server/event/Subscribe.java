/**
 * Marks a method as an event subscriber.
 *
 * <p>An event subscriber method:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>is annotated with {@link Subscribe};
 *     <li>is {@code public};
 *     <li>returns {@code void};
 *     <li>accepts an event derived from {@link com.google.protobuf.Message Message}
 *          as the first parameter;
 *     <li>(optional) accepts an {@link org.spine3.base.EventContext EventContext}
 *          as the second parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * If the annotation is applied to a method which doesn't satisfy any of these requirements,
 * this method is not considered as an event subscriber and is not registered for event delivery
 * from {@link EventBus}.
