/**
 * Marks a method as command handler.
 *
 * <p>A command handler method:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>is annotated with {@link Assign};
 *     <li>has a default access modifier;
 *     <li>returns an event derived from {@link com.google.protobuf.Message Message} or
 *          a {@link java.util.List List} of messages;
 *     <li>accepts a command derived from {@link com.google.protobuf.Message Message}
 *          as a first parameter;
 *     <li>(optional) accepts a {@link org.spine3.base.CommandContext CommandContext}
 *          as the second parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * If the annotation is applied to a method which doesn't satisfy any of these requirements,
 * this method is not considered as a command handler and is not registered for command dispatching.
 *
 * <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> an application must have one and only one handler per command class.
 * Declaring two methods that handle the same command class will result in run-time error.
