/**
 * Delivers the messages to the entities.
 *
 * <p>Splits the incoming messages into shards and allows to deliver the
 * messages to their destinations on a per-shard basis. Guarantees that one and only one
 * application server node serves the messages from the given shard at a time, thus preventing
 * any concurrent modifications of entity state.
 *
 * <p>Delegates the message dispatching and low-level handling of message duplicates to
 * {@link #newInbox(TypeUrl) Inbox}es of each target entity. The respective {@code Inbox} instances
 * should be created in each of {@code Entity} repositories.
 *
 * <h1>Configuration</h1>
 *
 * <h2>Delivery Strategy</h2>
 *
 * <p>By default, a shard is assigned according to the identifier of the target entity. The
 * messages heading to a single entity will always reside in a single shard. However,
 * the framework users may {@linkplain DeliveryBuilder#setStrategy(DeliveryStrategy) customize}
 * this behavior.
 *
 * <p>The typical customization would be to specify the same shard index for the related targets.
 * E.g. if there is an {@code OrderAggregate}, {@code OrderItemAggregate}
 * and {@code OrderItemProjection}, they could share the same shard index. In this way the messages
 * headed to these entities will be dispatched and processed together. In turn, that will reduce
 * the eventual consistency lag between {@code C} side (i.e. aggregate state updates)
 * and {@code Q} side (i.e. the respective updates in projections).
 *
 * <h2>Deduplication</h2>
 *
 * <p>As long as the underlying storage and transport mechanisms are restricted by the CAP theorem,
 * there may be duplicates in the messages written, read or dispatched. The {@code Delivery}
 * responds to it by storing some of the already delivered messages for longer and using them as
 * a source for deduplication.
 *
 * <p>{@linkplain DeliveryBuilder#setDeduplicationWindow(Duration) Provides} the time-based
 * deduplication capabilities to eliminate the messages, which may have been already delivered
 * to their targets. The duplicates will be detected among the messages, which are not older, than
 * {@code now - [deduplication window]}.
 *
 * <h2>Customizing {@code InboxStorage}</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code Delivery} is responsible for providing the {@link InboxStorage} for every inbox
 * registered. Framework users may {@linkplain DeliveryBuilder#setInboxStorage(InboxStorage)
 * configure} the storage. By default, the {@code InboxStorage} for the delivery is provided
 * by the environment-specific {@linkplain ServerEnvironment#storageFactory() storage factory}
 * and is single-tenant. In case there is at least one multi-tenant {@code BoundedContext}
 * served by the {@code Delivery}, the {@code InboxStorage} should be configured
 * to support the multi-tenancy.
 *
 * <h2>Catch-up</h2>
 *
 * <p>In addition to delivering the messages sent in a real-time, {@code Delivery} dispatches
 * the historical events sent to the catching-up projections. These events are dispatched through
 * the same shards as the live messages. A special {@link CatchUpStation} is responsible for
 * handling this use-case. See more on that in the respective section.
 *
 * <p>To control how many historical events are read and put into shards, the end-users may
 * configure the {@linkplain DeliveryBuilder#setCatchUpPageSize(int) maximum number of messages}
 * read from the history at a time. This is helpful to balance the per-shard throughput, so
 * that the live messages are still dispatched through the same shards in a reasonable time.
 *
 * <p>The statuses of the ongoing catch-up processes are stored in a dedicated
 * {@link CatchUpStorage}. The {@code DeliveryBuilder} {@linkplain
 * DeliveryBuilder#setCatchUpStorage(CatchUpStorage) exposes an API} for the customization of this
 * storage. By default, the {@code CatchUpStorage} is single-tenant. However,
 * as with the {@code InboxStorage} used by the {@code Delivery}, it should be configured
 * as multi-tenant if at least one {@code BoundedContext} served by the {@code Delivery}
 * is multi-tenant.
 *
 * <h2>Observers</h2>
 *
 * <p>Once a message is written to the {@code Inbox},
 * the {@linkplain Delivery#subscribe(ShardObserver) pre-configured shard observers} are
 * {@linkplain ShardObserver#onMessage(InboxMessage) notified}. In this way any third-party
 * environment planners, load balancers, and schedulers may plug into the delivery and perform
 * various routines to enable the further processing of the sharded messages. In a distributed
 * environment a message queue may be used to notify the node cluster of a shard that has some
 * messages pending for the delivery.
 *
 * <h2>Work registry</h2>
 *
 * <p>Once an application node picks the shard to deliver the messages from it, it registers itself
 * in a {@link ShardedWorkRegistry}. It serves as a list of locks-per-shard that only allows
 * to pick a shard to a single node at a time. The framework users may configure the implementation
 * of the registry by calling {@link DeliveryBuilder#setWorkRegistry(ShardedWorkRegistry)}.
 *
 * <h2>Dispatching messages</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Delivery stages</h3>
 *
 * <p>The delivery process for each shard index is split into {@link DeliveryStage}s. In scope of
 * each stage, a certain number of messages is read from the respective shard of the {@code Inbox}.
 * The messages are grouped per-target and delivered in batches if possible. The maximum
 * number of the messages within a {@code DeliveryStage} can be
 * {@linkplain DeliveryBuilder#setPageSize(int) configured}.
 *
 * <p>After each {@code DeliveryStage} it is possible to stop the delivery by
 * {@link DeliveryBuilder#setMonitor(DeliveryMonitor) supplying} a custom delivery monitor.
 * Please refer to the {@link DeliveryMonitor documentation} for the details.
 *
 * <h3>Conveyor and stations</h3>
 *
 * <p>In a scope of {@code DeliveryStage} the page of the {@code InboxMessage}s is placed
 * to the {@link Conveyor} responsible for tracking the status of each message.
 * The conveyor is run through the pipeline of stations, each modifying the state of the messages.
 * At the end of the pipeline, the changed made to the messages are committed to the underlying
 * {@code InboxStorage} in a bulk. Such an approach allows to minimize the number of the requests
 * sent to the storage.
 *
 * <p>As long as the new {@code DeliveryStage} is started, the new instance of the {@code Conveyor}
 * is created.
 *
 * <p>Below is the list of the conveyor stations in the pipeline.
 *
 * <b>1. Catch-up station</b>
 *
 * <p>This station is responsible for dispatching the historical events in
 * {@link InboxMessageStatus#TO_CATCH_UP TO_CATCH_UP} status to the respective targets. Also,
 * while the target entity is under a catch-up, all the live messages headed to it are ignored.
 * Once the catch-up is completed, this station handles the transition period, in which the last
 * batch of the historical events and live messages are dispatched together.
 * See {@link CatchUpStation} for more details.
 *
 * <b>2. Live delivery station</b>
 *
 * <p>This station is responsible for dispatching the messages sent in a real-time. It ignores
 * the messages in {@link InboxMessageStatus#TO_CATCH_UP TO_CATCH_UP} status. Another responsibility
 * of this station is to set for how long the delivered messages should be kept according to the
 * {@linkplain DeliveryBuilder#setDeduplicationWindow(Duration) deduplication window} settings.
 * See {@link LiveDeliveryStation} for more details.
 *
 * <b>3. Cleanup station</b>
 *
 * <p>This station removes the messages which are already delivered and are no longer needed for the
 * deduplication. See {@link CleanupStation} for the description.
 *
 * <b>Deduplication</b>
 *
 * <p>During the dispatching, {@code Conveyor} keeps track of the delivered messages. The stations
 * performing the actual message dispatching rely onto this knowledge and deduplicate
 * the messages prior to calling the target's endpoint.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, the {@code Delivery} provides a {@linkplain DeliveredMessages cache of recently
 * delivered messages}. Each instance of the {@code Conveyor} has an access to it and uses it
 * in deduplication procedures.
 *
 * <h2>Local environment</h2>
 *
 * <p>By default, the delivery is configured to {@linkplain Delivery#local() run locally}. It
 * uses {@linkplain LocalDispatchingObserver see-and-dispatch observer}, which delivers the
 * messages from the observed shard once a message is passed to its
 * {@link LocalDispatchingObserver#onMessage(InboxMessage) onMessage(InboxMessage)} method. This
 * process is synchronous.
 *
 * <p>To deal with the multi-threaded access in a local mode,
 * an {@linkplain InMemoryShardedWorkRegistry} is used. It operates on top of the
 * {@code synchronized} in-memory data structures and prevents several threads from picking up the
 * same shard.
 *
 * <h2>Shard maintenance</h2>
 *
 * <p>To perform the maintenance procedures, the {@code Delivery} requires all the {@code
 * BoundedContext}s to register themselves in it. Upon this registration, a special
 * {@link ShardMaintenanceProcess} is registered as an event dispatcher in a passed
 * {@code BoundedContext}. Such a registration is performed automatically when the context is
 * {@linkplain  io.spine.server.BoundedContextBuilder#build() built}.
