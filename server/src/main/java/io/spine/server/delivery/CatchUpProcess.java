/**
 * A process that performs a projection catch-up.
 *
 * <p>Starts the catch-up process by emitting the {@link CatchUpRequested} event.
 *
 * <p>Has its own {@link Inbox}, so the messages arriving to it are dispatched by the
 * {@link Delivery}.
 *
 * <p>While recalling the event history, the process relies on the work of {@code Delivery},
 * which follows the status of the process and delivers messages in {@code TO_CATCH_UP} status
 * instead of live {@code TO_DELIVER} messages to the catching-up targets.
 *
 * <p>The tricky part is so called "turbulence" period, i.e. the time when the catch-up comes
 * close to the current time in the event history. In this phase the task is to understand when to
 * stop reading the history and switch back to delivering the live events dispatched to the
 * catching-up projections. To do so, a special {@code FINALIZING} status is introduced. Observed
 * by {@code Delivery} it tells to perform a transition from dispatching {@code TO_CATCH_UP} events
 * back to delivering those {@code TO_DELIVER}. See more on that below.
 *
 * <p>In this version of the process implementation, the turbulence period always equals 500 ms
 * meaning that the catch-up starts its finalization when the event history is read
 * up until {@code now - 500 ms}.
 *
 * <p>In its lifecycle, the process moves through the several statuses.
 *
 * <h3>{@linkplain CatchUpStatus#CUS_UNDEFINED Not started}</h3>
 *
 * <p>The process is created in this status upon receiving the {@code CatchUpRequested} event.
 * The further actions include:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>A {@link CatchUpStarted} event is emitted. The target projection repository listens to
 *     this event and kills the state of the matching entities.
 *
 *     <li>The status if the catch-up process is set to {@link CatchUpStatus#IN_PROGRESS
 *     IN_PROGRESS}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>{@linkplain CatchUpStatus#STARTED STARTED}</h3>
 *
 * <p>The process is created in this status upon receiving the {@code CatchUpRequested} event.
 * The further actions include:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>A {@link CatchUpStarted} event is emitted. The target projection repository listens to
 *     this event and kills the state of the matching entities.
 *
 *     <li>The status if the catch-up process is set to {@link CatchUpStatus#IN_PROGRESS
 *     IN_PROGRESS}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>{@link CatchUpStatus#IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS}</h3>
 *
 * <p>When the process is in this status, the event history is read and the matching events are sent
 * to the {@code Inbox}es of the corresponding projections
 *
 * <p>The catch-up maintains this status until the history is read till the point in time,
 * which is very close to the {@link Time#currentTime() Time.currentTime()}. When this time comes,
 * the events arriving to the {@code EventStore} are very likely to be just-emitted in a live mode.
 * Therefore, the process needs to decide whether to decide that the history is fully read, or
 * to continue the traversal through the history.
 *
 * <p>At this stage the actions are as follows.
 *
 * <ol>
 *      <li>The historical event messages are read from the {@link EventStore} respecting
 *      the time range requested and the time of the last read operation performed by this process.
 *      The maximum number of the events read is determined by
 *      {@linkplain DeliveryBuilder#setCatchUpPageSize(int) one of the Delivery settings}.
 *
 *      <li>Depending on the targets requested for the catch-up, the events are posted to the
 *      corresponding entities.
 *
 *      <li>Unless the timestamps of the events are getting close to the current time, an
 *      {@link HistoryEventsRecalled} is emitted, leaving the process in the {@code IN_PROGRESS}
 *      status and triggering the next round similar to this one.
 *
 *      <p>If the timestamps of the events read on this step are as close to the current time as
 *      the turbulence period, the {@link HistoryFullyRecalled} is emitted.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>{@link CatchUpStatus#FINALIZING FINALIZING}</h3>
 *
 * <p>The process moves to this status when the event history has been fully recalled and the
 * corresponding {@code HistoryFullyRecalled} is received. At this stage, the {@code Delivery} stops
 * the propagation of the events to the catch-up messages, waiting for this process to populate
 * the inboxes with the messages arriving to be dispatched during the turbulence period.
 * Potentially, the inboxes will contain the duplicates produced by both the live users
 * and this process. To deal with it, a deduplication is performed by the {@code Delivery}.
 * See {@link CatchUpStation} for more details.
 *
 * <p>The historical data pushed by the catch-up is dispatched through a number of shards,
 * each processed by the {@code Delivery} independently from each other. Starting to dispatch
 * the events from a shard, {@code Delivery} reads the details of the ongoing catch-up processes.
 * By interpreting the status of each catch-up, {@code Delivery} decides on the actions to apply
 * to the historical events. For instance, the historical events dispatched from a catch-up which
 * is already {@code COMPLETED} are considered junk and are immediately deleted.
 *
 * <p>Before moving to the catch-up completion, it is required to make sure every historical event
 * has been seen and dispatched by the {@code Delivery}. So if the catch-up process is moved
 * to the {@code COMPLETED} state too early, some historical events will get stuck in limbo, and
 * will eventually be deleted.
 *
 * <p>It's important to understand that different shards may be processed at different speeds and
 * potentially by different application nodes. Therefore, in order to switch to the
 * {@code COMPLETED} status, a catch-up process must ensure that <b>each</b> shard was processed
 * by the {@code Delivery} which witnessed the catch-up process in its {@code FINALIZING} state.
 * Such an evidence would mean that this {@code Delivery} run is at the point in time by which
 * three things already happened:
 *
 * <ol type="a">
 *     <li>the catch-up process has emitted all the events from the history,
 *
 *     <li>the catch-up process has sent {@link HistoryFullyRecalled} after the historical events,
 *
 *     <li>all these events were dispatched already — otherwise, the process wasn't going
 *     to be in its {@code FINALIZING} state.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>In order to guarantee that prior to moving to the {@code COMPLETED} status, the catch-up
 * process emits special {@link ShardProcessingRequested} events for each shard. The events are
 * dispatched to a {@link ShardMaintenanceProcess}, which responds back by emitting
 * {@link ShardProcessed} events. The {@code Delivery} knows about this special-case signals
 * and appends the data in these events with its own picture of ongoing catch-up
 * processes and their statuses. By receiving {@code ShardProcessed} events populated with this
 * information the catch-up process knows which status was seen by the {@code Delivery}
 * at the moment when it had been dispatching the events from a certain shard.
 *
 * <p>The actions at this stage are as follows.
 *
 * <ol>
 *      <li>All the remaining messages of the matching event types are read {@link EventStore}.
 *      In this operation the read limits set by the {@code Delivery} are NOT used, since
 *      the goal is to read the remainder of the events.
 *
 *      <li>The {@link LiveEventsPickedUp} event is emitted. This allows some time for the posted
 *      events to become visible to the {@code Delivery}.
 *
 *      <li>In the next round of delivery, the emitted {@link LiveEventsPickedUp} event is
 *      dispatched back to this process. By this time, the last batch of the historical events
 *      has already been sent to their destinations. However, not all of them may have been yet
 *      delivered due to their large number or to the I/O performance. To ensure that every
 *      historical event was seen by the {@code Delivery}, a special
 *      {@link ShardProcessingRequested} event is emitted for every shard involved into
 *      dispatching the historical events up until now.
 *
 *      <li>Each {@link ShardProcessingRequested} event triggers the {@code Delivery} to read
 *      and dispatch the signals from a specific shard. Being sent, these events are dispatched
 *      to a special system {@link ShardMaintenanceProcess} serving as a handler. By reacting
 *      to a {@code ShardProcessingRequested}, the latter maintenance process emits
 *      a {@link ShardProcessed} event, telling that the {@code Delivery} has worked its way
 *      through the messages present in this shard.
 *
 *      <li>The catch-up process handles each {@code ShardProcessed} event. By gathering the data
 *      from these events, the catch-up is able to tell when all the affected shards were
 *      fully processed by the {@code Delivery}. Once all shards are processed,
 *      a {@link CatchUpCompleted} event is emitted.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>{@link CatchUpStatus#COMPLETED COMPLETED}</h3>
 *
 * <p>Once the {@code CatchUpCompleted} event is received, the process moves
 * to the {@code COMPLETED} status. At this point, some live events and some historical events which
 * were located in the "turbulence" window are still paused for dispatching. To ensure they are
 * processed in each shard, the catch-up emits a number of {@code ShardProcessingRequested} events
 * again. By dispatching them, it makes sure that the {@code Delivery} observes the change of
 * catch-up status to {@code COMPLETED} and moves onto de-duplicating and delivering the previously
 * "paused" events.
 *
 * <p>After that, a normal delivery flow is resumed. The catch-up process stops its execution.
 *

 *         the type of identifiers of the processed projections
 * @implNote Technically, the instances of this class are not
 *         {@linkplain io.spine.server.procman.ProcessManager process managers}, since it is
 *         impossible to register the process managers with the same state in
 *         a multi-{@code BoundedContext} application.
