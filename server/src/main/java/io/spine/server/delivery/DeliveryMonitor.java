 * <p>In some cases when a funnel-like {@code Entity} (e.g. some projection of a business report
 * subscribed to half of the domain events) has a lot of messages in its {@code Inbox},
 * the delivery process may be slowed down for other targets in the same shard, while
 * all the messages are being dispatched the "busy" {@code Entity}. Depending on the number
 * of messages to deliver, it may take a lot of time.
 *
 * <p>Environments such as Google AppEngine Standard imply restrictions on the duration of the
 * request processing. Therefore, it may be necessary to stop the message delivery for this shard
 * at some point, and re-schedule the shard processing again by sending another request and
