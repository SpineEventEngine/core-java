/**
 * Annotates a <strong>static</strong> method of an {@link io.spine.server.entity.Entity Entity}
 * class for arranging message routing for this class of entities.
 *
 * <p>The method must accept a {@link io.spine.base.SignalMessage SignalMessage} as the first
 * parameter, and <em>may</em> contain corresponding
 * {@link io.spine.base.MessageContext MessageContext} as the second parameter.
 *
 * <p>The method <em>must</em> return one identifier of type {@code <I>} for {@link Unicast}
 * dispatching, and <em>may</em> return an {@code Iterable<I>}, if this message can be dispatched
 * via {@linkplain Multicast multicast}.
 *
 * <p>When used in Java, the method <strong>must</strong> be either package-private or
 * {@code protected} for being accessible from the generated code in the same package.
 * <p>The {@code protected} modifier should be used <em>only</em> in the very rare cases of
 * dealing with {@linkplain io.spine.core.ContractFor entity class hierarchies}.
 *
 * <p>When used in Kotlin, the methods <strong>must</strong> be {@code internal},
 * with {@code @Route} the annotation of a companion object method,
 * followed by the {@code @JvmStatic} annotation.
 * This is to make the method visible as static to the Java runtime.
