/**
 * This package defines the Spine Trace API.
 *
 * <p>The API allows users integrate with various tracing systems in order to monitor the message
 * flow in their systems.
 *
 * <p>The API is invoked via system events which occur when a message is processed by an entity.
 *
 * <p>Currently, Trace API does not support monitoring standalone commanders, reactors,
 * and subscribers. It is only applicable to entities, such as
 * {@link io.spine.server.aggregate.Aggregate Aggregates},
 * {@link io.spine.server.procman.ProcessManager ProcessManagers},
 * and {@link io.spine.server.projection.Projection Projections}.
 *
 * <p>The entry point to integrating a third-party tracing system with a Spine-based application is
 * {@link io.spine.server.trace.TracerFactory}. A single {@code TracerFactory} can be used in one or
 * more bounded contexts.
 *
 * @see io.spine.server.trace.TracerFactory
 * @see io.spine.server.trace.Tracer
 * @see io.spine.server.ServerEnvironment#tracing()
