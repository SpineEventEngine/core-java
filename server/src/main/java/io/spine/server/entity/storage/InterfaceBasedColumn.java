/**
 * A column declared with the help of {@link io.spine.base.EntityWithColumns}-derived interface.
 *
 * <p>An interface-based column is:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Declared in Protobuf with {@code (column)} option:
 *         <pre>
 *         int32 year_of_registration = 8 [(column) = true];
 *         </pre>
 *     <li>Implemented using custom Spine-generated interface:
 *         <pre>
 *         interface UserProfileWithColumns extends EntityWithColumns {
 *             int getYearOfRegistration();
 *         }
 *
 *         // ...
 *         class UserProfileProjection
 * {@literal            extends Projection<UserId, UserProfile, UserProfile.Builder>  }
 *             implements UserProfileWithColumns {
 *
 *            {@literal @}Override
 *             public int getYearOfRegistration() {
 *                 return yearOfRegistration;
 *             }
 *         }
 *         </pre>
 *     <li>Extracted from the entity and propagated to the entity state at the moment of
 *         transaction commit. The column value is finalized by this moment.
