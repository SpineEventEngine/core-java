/**
 * Callbacks for a {@link HandlerMethod} invocation.

 * <p>If the target of the method implements {@code HandlerLifecycle}, it is invoked alongside
 * handler method. For example:
 * <pre>
 * class SignUpSubscriber extends AbstractEventSubscriber implements HandlerLifecycle {
 *
 *    {@literal @Subscribe}
 *     void on(UserSignedUp event) {
 *         // ...

 *     }
 *
 *    {@literal @Override}
 *     public void afterInvoke(HandlerMethod<?, ?, ?, ?> method) {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>When a {@code UserSignedUp} event is dispatched to the {@code SignUpSubscriber},
 * the invocation order goes as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@code beforeInvoke([instance representing on(UserSignedUp) method])}.
 *     <li>{@code on(UserSignedUp)}.
 *     <li>{@code afterInvoke([instance representing on(UserSignedUp) method])}.
