/**
 * Dispatches {@linkplain ExternalMessage external messages} from and to a Bounded Context with
 * which this broker is associated.
 *
 * <p>In a multi-component environment messages may travel across components from one
 * Bounded Context to another. Accordingly, an {@code IntegrationBroker} is available as a part
 * of a Bounded Context.
 *
 * <p>An {@code IntegrationBroker} is always based upon {@linkplain TransportFactory transport}
 * that delivers messages from and to it. For several Bounded Contexts to communicate, their brokers
 * have to share the transport. Typically, that would be a single message queue.
 *
 * <p>{@code IntegrationBroker}s communicate with each other in order to keep the whole list of
 * wanted external events and their potential sources (Bounded Contexts) up-to-date.
 * They use two special messages for this:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link BoundedContextOnline} is sent when a broker (and through it, its Bounded Context)
 *     is connected to the transport
 *     <li>{@link ExternalEventsWanted} is sent
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>in response to {@link BoundedContextOnline} sent by other brokers;
 *         <li>when the collection of external events is updated inside of a Bounded Context.
 *     </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Receiving</b>
 *
 * <p>The messages from external components received by an {@code IntegrationBroker} via
 * the transport are propagated into the Bounded Context via the domestic {@code EventBus}.
 *
 * <p><b>Publishing</b>
 *
 * <p>The messages requested by other parties are published from the domestic
 * {@code EventBus} with the help of {@linkplain DomesticEventPublisher special dispatcher}.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage</b>
 *
 * <p>Bounded Context "Projects" has a projection with an event receptor that is subscribed to an
 * external event as follows:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public class ProjectListView extends Projection<...>  {
 *
 *     {@literal @}Subscribe
 *      public void on(@External UserDeleted event) {
 *          // Remove the projects that belong to this user.
 *          // ...
 *      }
 *  }
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Upon a registration of the corresponding repository for this projection in the context,
 * the broker associated with that context is informed that one more external event is needed.
 * It sends out an updated {@code ExternalEventsWanted} saying that {@code UserDeleted}
 * events are needed too.
 *
 * <p>Let's say the second Context is "Users". Its broker will receive
 * the {@code ExternalEventsWanted} sent by "Projects". To handle it, it will create a bridge
 * between "Users"'s Event Bus (which may eventually be transmitting a {@code UserDeleted} event)
 * and the {@linkplain ServerEnvironment#transportFactory() transport}.
 *
 * <p>Once {@code UserDeleted} is emitted locally in "Users" context, it will be received
 * by this bridge (as well as other local dispatchers) and published to the external transport by
 * its {@code IntegrationBroker}.
 *
 * <p>The integration broker on the "Projects" side will receive the {@code UserDeleted}
 * external message. The event will be dispatched to the external event receptor of the projection.
 *
 * <p><b>Limitations</b>
 *
 * <p>An event type may be consumed by many Contexts but produced only by a single Context. This
 * means that each given event type belongs only to one Context. The ownership of an event type may
 * be changed between the versions of a system, but may not be changed while events are travelling
 * between the Contexts.
