/**
 * Marks a method as command handler.
 *
 * <p>A command handler method <strong>must</strong>:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>be annotated with {@link Assign @Assign};
 *
 *     <li>have package-private visibility;
 *
 *     <li>return an event message derived from {@link com.google.protobuf.Message Message}
 *     if there is only one event generated;
 *     <strong>or</strong> an {@link java.lang.Iterable Iterable} of event messages for two or
 *     more events;
 *
 *     <li>accept a command message derived from {@link com.google.protobuf.Message Message}
 *         as the first parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A command handler method <strong>may</strong> accept a {@link io.spine.core.CommandContext
 * CommandContext} as the second parameter, if handling of the command requires its context.

 * <p>If the annotation is applied to a method which doesn't satisfy any of these requirements,
 * this method is not considered a command handler and is <strong>not</strong> registered for
 * command dispatching.
 *
 * <p>A command handler method <strong>should</strong> have package-private access. It will allow
 * calling this method from tests. The method should not be {@code public} because it is not
 * supposed to be called directly.
 *
 * <h2>One Handler per Command</h2>
 *
 * <p>An application must have one and only one handler per command message class.
 * This includes {@linkplain io.spine.server.command.Command the case} of transforming an incoming
 * command into one or more commands that will to be handled instead of the received one.
 *
 * <p>Declaring two methods that handle the same command class will result in run-time error.
