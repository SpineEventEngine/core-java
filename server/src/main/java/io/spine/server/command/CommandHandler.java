/**
 * The abstract base for non-aggregate classes that expose command handling methods
 * and post their results to {@link EventBus}.
 *
 * <p>A command handler is responsible for:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Changing the state of the business model in response to a command.
 *     This is done by one of the command handling methods to which the handler dispatches
 *     the command.
 *     <li>Producing corresponding events.
 *     <li>Posting events to {@code EventBus}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Event messages are returned as values of command handling methods.
 *
 * <p>A command handler does not have own state. So the state of the business
 * model it changes is external to it. Even though such a behaviour may be needed in
 * some rare cases, using {@linkplain io.spine.server.aggregate.Aggregate aggregates}
 * is a preferred way of handling commands.
 *
 * <p>This class implements {@code CommandDispatcher} dispatching messages
 * to methods declared in the derived classes.
