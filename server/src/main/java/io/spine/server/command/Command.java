/**
 * Marks a commanding method.
 *
 * <p>A commanding method <strong>must</strong>:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>be annotated with {@link Command @Command};
 *     <li>return a command message derived from {@link io.spine.base.CommandMessage
 *         CommandMessage}, if there is only one command to be generated;
 *         <strong>or</strong> an {@code Iterable} of command messages for two or more commands;
 *     <li>accept one of the following as the first parameter:
 *     <ul>
 *        <li>a {@linkplain io.spine.base.CommandMessage command message};
 *        <li>an {@linkplain io.spine.base.EventMessage event message};
 *        <li>a {@linkplain io.spine.base.RejectionMessage rejection message}.
 *     </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A commanding method <strong>may</strong> accept a context of the incoming message
 * ({@link io.spine.core.CommandContext CommandContext} or
 * {@link io.spine.core.EventContext EventContext} correspondingly) as the second parameter, if
 * handling of the command requires its context.
 *
 * <p>If the annotation is applied to a method which doesn't satisfy any of these requirements,
 * this method is not considered a command handler and is <strong>not</strong> registered for
 * command generation.
 *
 * <h1>Throwables</h1>
 * <p>A commanding method may throw a {@link io.spine.base.ThrowableMessage ThrowableMessage}
 * <em>if, and only if</em> it accepts a command message. This means that the incoming command
 * may be either rejected, or substituting command(s) must be generated.
 *
 * <p>Throwing {@linkplain Throwable other types} in command transforming methods in not allowed.
 *
 * <p>Commanding methods accepting events or rejections may not throw.
 *
 * <h2>Access Modifiers</h2>
 *
 * <p>A commanding method <strong>should</strong> have package-private access. It will allow
 * calling this method from tests. The method should not be {@code public} because it is not
 * supposed to be called directly.
 *
 * <h2>Handle or Transform a Command</h2>
 *
 * <p>An application can either {@linkplain io.spine.server.command.Assign handle} an incoming
 * command <strong>or</strong> transform it into one or more commands that will be handled instead.
 * Because of this, a commanding method cannot accept a command message, if there is already a
 * command handling method which accepts the command message type.
 *
 * <p>If a commanding method accepts a command type which is also handled by the application
 * by another method, a run-time error will occur. This also means that an application cannot have
 * two commanding methods that accept the same command type.
