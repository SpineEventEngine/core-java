/**
 * Migrates {@link Mirror} projections into {@link EntityRecordWithColumns}.
 *
 * <p>{@code Mirror} projection was deprecated in Spine 2.0. Previously, it was used to store
 * aggregates' states to allow their querying. A single projection stored states of <b>all</b>
 * aggregates in a Bounded Context.
 *
 * <p>Now, {@link EntityRecordStorage} is used to store the aggregate's states when it is
 * open for querying. This storage is created on a <b>per-aggregate</b> basis. This enables
 * storing of queryable state-based columns along the state itself. For this reason, the migration
 * is also done on a per-aggregate basis.
 *
 * <p>In Spine 2.0 a new optional field has been added to {@code Mirror}.
 * {@link Mirror#getWasMigrated()} tells whether the given mirror record was already migrated.
 * The migration relies on a value of this field. It migrates only those records, for which a value
 * of this field is not set at all or equals to {@code false}.
 *
 * <p>There is no particular ordering in which mirrors are fetched. For every batch
 * just the first {@code x} non-migrated records are queried. But, limiting the resulting dataset
 * requires at least one sorting directive. For this reason, the query result is additionally sorted
 * by {@link Mirror#getWasMigrated()}, which in fact makes no effect on the resulting dataset.
 *
 * <p>Mirrors, which are marked as archived or deleted – will be migrated as well.
 *
 * <p><b>An example usage</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create an instance of `MirrorMigration`.
 *
 * var context = ContextSpec.singleTenant("...");
 * var factory = ServerEnvironment.instance().storageFactory();
 * var aggToMigrate = ParcelAgg.class;
 * var migration = new MirrorMigration(context, factory, aggToMigrate);
 *
 * // Create an instance of `MirrorMigrationMonitor`. We are going to use
 * // a default implementation, which always continues the migration.
 * // Also, the mirrors will be migrated in batches of 500 records.
 *
 * var batchSize = 500;
 * var monitor = new MirrorMigrationMonitor(batchSize);
 *
 * // Run the migration.
 *
 * migration.run(monitor);
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <I>
 *         the aggregate's identifier
 * @param <S>
 *         the aggregate's state
 * @param <A>
 *         the aggregate's class
