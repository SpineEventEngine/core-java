/**
 * A factory for creating storages used by repositories, {@link EventStore EventStore}
 * and {@link io.spine.server.delivery.Delivery}.
 *
 * <p>The applications built with Spine use serialized Protobuf messages as a format of
 * storing the data objects. There is a number of storage types, each of them packs
 * their run-time information into a Proto message of a certain kind.
 *
 * <p>In order to unify the structure of the stored information and the way of its further
 * retrieval, a {@link RecordStorage} type is made a common ground for all other storage
 * types. It is capable of storing and querying any Protobuf messages, and provides
 * a configuration API for detailing on how each message is transformed into a stored record.
 *
 * <p>To achieve that, each of the storage classes starts its own initialization by creating
 * an underlying {@code RecordStorage} and customizing it with a {@linkplain RecordSpec
 * specification of the Proto message} to store. Once that is done, all operations are
 * run through this delegate instance.
 *
 * <p>Such an approach brings another advantage for SPI users, too. It is sufficient to provide
 * just a new {@code RecordStorage} implementation in order to extend the storage factory
 * to support a certain DBMS. The rest of storage types just remain as delegating types,
 * and their code may be kept agnostic of low-level DBMS details. However, if one wants to extend
 * the functionality even further, any storage type may be extended and customized.
 *
 * <p>Another design intention is that all storage types which are presumed to work in a scope of
 * some Bounded Context — down to a {@code RecordStorage} — would take a {@linkplain ContextSpec
 * context specification} as the first parameter. An idea is that they may need to use
 * the properties of the Bounded Context (such as its name) in their low-level I/O with
 * the database. Only two of the storage types do not follow this concept: {@link InboxStorage}
 * and {@link CatchUpStorage}. The reason for that is that they are a part of
 * a {@link io.spine.server.delivery.Delivery} which is shared across all domain Bounded Contexts.
 * One more storage which stands apart from this idea is
 * a {@link io.spine.server.tenant.TenantStorage}. While it uses a {@code StorageFactory}
 * for an initialization, it is a part of a special {@code Tenants} context, which is also shared
 * between domain Bounded Contexts of an application.
 *
 * <p>See the package-level documentation of {@code io.spine.query} for more details on
 * record specification and querying.
