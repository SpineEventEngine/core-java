/**
 * An error indicating that two message handlers have clashing
 * {@linkplain io.spine.core.ByField ByField filtering} signatures.
 *
 * <p>Two handlers clash if they handle the same type of message but filter messages by different
 * fields. For example:
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 *     \@Subscribe(filter = @ByField(path = "member_count", value = "0"))
 *     public void onProject(ProjectStarted event) {
 *     }
 *
 *     \@Subscribe(filter = @ByField(path = "by.admin", value = "false"))
 *     public void onStarted(ProjectStarted event) {
 *     }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Both methods {@code onProject} and {@code onStarted} subscribe to {@code ProjectStarted} but
 * filter the events by {@code member_count} and {@code by.admin} fields respectively. This is
 * an invalid situation, since both filters could be satisfied simultaneously.
