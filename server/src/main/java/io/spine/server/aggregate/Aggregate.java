/**
 * Abstract base for aggregates.
 *
 * <p>An aggregate is the main building block of a business model.
 * Aggregates guarantee consistency of data modifications in response to
 * commands they receive.
 *
 * <p>An aggregate modifies its state in response to a command and produces
 * one or more events. These events are used later to restore the state of the
 * aggregate.
 *
 * <h1>Creating an aggregate class</h1>
 *
 * <p>In order to create a new aggregate class you need to:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Select a type for identifiers of the aggregate.
 *      If you select to use a typed identifier (which is recommended),
 *      you need to define a protobuf message for the ID type.
 *     <li>Define the structure of the aggregate state as a Protobuf message.
 *     <li>Generate Java code for ID and state types.
 *     <li>Create new Java class derived from {@code Aggregate} passing ID and
 *     state types as generic parameters.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Adding command handler methods</h2>
 *
 * <p>Command handling methods of an {@code Aggregate} are defined in
 * the same way as described in {@link CommandHandlingEntity}.
 *
 * <p>Event(s) returned by command handling methods are posted to
 * the {@link io.spine.server.event.EventBus EventBus} automatically
 * by {@link AggregateRepository}.
 *
 * <h2>Adding event applier methods</h2>
 *
 * <p>Aggregate data is stored as a sequence of events it produces.
 * The state of the aggregate is restored by re-playing the history of
 * events and invoking corresponding <em>event applier methods</em>.
 *
 * <p>An event applier is a method that changes the state of the aggregate
 * in response to an event. An event applier takes a single parameter of the
 * event message it handles and returns {@code void}.
 *
 * <p>The modification of the state is done via a builder instance obtained
 * from {@link #builder()}.
 *
 * <p>An {@code Aggregate} class must have applier methods for
 * <em>all</em> types of the events that it produces.
 *
 * <h1>Performance considerations</h1>
 *
 * <p>In order to improve performance of loading aggregates an
 * {@link AggregateRepository} periodically stores aggregate snapshots.
 * See {@link AggregateRepository#setSnapshotTrigger(int)} for details.
 *
 * @param <I> the type for IDs of this class of aggregates
 * @param <S> the type of the state held by the aggregate
 * @param <B> the type of the aggregate state builder
