 * A part of a larger aggregate.
 *
 * <p>Some business logic objects may be big enough.
 * If not all parts of such a business object need to be preserved at the same
 * time as business logic invariants, such an object can be split into several parts.
 *
 * <p>Each such part would:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>be a class derived from {@code AggregatePart}
 *   <li>have the same aggregate ID as other parts belonging to the same business object
 *   <li>have own state defined as a Protobuf message
 *   <li>managed by a separate repository class derived from {@link AggregateRepository}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In order to access parts of the aggregate {@link AggregateRoot} should be used.
 *
 * <p>If your business logic cannot be split into parts that can be modified separately,
 * consider extending {@link Aggregate} instead of several {@code AggregatePart}s.
