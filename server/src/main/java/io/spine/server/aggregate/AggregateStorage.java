/**
 * A storage of aggregate events, snapshots and the most recent aggregate states.
 *
 * <p>The instances of this type solve two problems.
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>efficient loading of an Aggregate instance from its events;
 *
 *     <li>storing the latest state of an Aggregate along with its lifecycle flags to allow
 *     its further querying.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Storing Aggregate events</h3>
 *
 * <p>Each Aggregate is an event-sourced Entity. To load an Aggregate instance, one plays all
 * the events emitted by it, eventually obtaining the last known state. While the Event Store
 * of a Bounded Context, to which some Aggregate belongs, stores all domain events, using it
 * for the sake of loading an Aggregate is inefficient in most cases. An overwhelming number of
 * the domain events emitted in a Bounded Context and the restrictions applied by an underlying
 * storage tools make searching for the events of a particular Aggregate a difficult task, given
 * that the events are constantly being appended to the respective Event Store.
 *
 * <p>This storage duplicates a portion of events emitted by the Aggregates of a certain type.
 * It dramatically narrows down the number of storage records to traverse when loading.
 * Additionally, this storage is responsible for storing the intermediate snapshots of Aggregate
 * states, incorporating them into an optimized loading routines. The history of an Aggregate
 * is being read from the most recent event till its most recent snapshot, which reduces
 * the I/O between the underlying storage and application even more and enhances the overall
 * system performance.
 *
 * <p>In order to store events and snapshots, an intermediate {@link AggregateEventStorage} is
 * created. It persists data as Protobuf message records in its pre-configured
 * {@link io.spine.server.storage.RecordStorage RecordStorage}.
 *
 * <h3>Storing and querying the latest Aggregate states</h3>
 *
 * <p>End-users of the framework are able to set the visibility level for each Aggregate state
 * by using an {@linkplain io.spine.server.entity.EntityVisibility (entity).visibility} option
 * in the Protobuf message corresponding to the Aggregate state. For those Aggregates which are
 * visible, the framework routines {@linkplain #enableStateQuerying() enable this storage}
 * to persist the latest states of Aggregates and allow their further
 * {@linkplain #readStates(TargetFilters, ResponseFormat) querying}. To some extent, it makes this
 * storage a part of an application's read-side.
 *
 * <p>Similar to storages of other Entity types, {@code AggregateStorage} supports querying
 * the Aggregate states by the values of their declared entity columns. See {@code io.spine.query}
 * package docs for more details on the query language.
 *
 * <p>However, even if the Aggregate visibility is set to
 * {@link io.spine.option.EntityOption.Visibility#NONE NONE}, the storage still persists
 * the essential bits of Aggregate as-an-Entity. Namely, its identifier, its lifecycle flags
 * and version. Such a behavior allows to speed up the execution of calls such
 * as {@linkplain #index() obtaining an index} of Aggregate identifiers, which otherwise would
 * involve major scans of event storage, with {@code DISTINCT} group operation applied.
 *
 * <p>As long as the Aggregate states are no different in their persistence from other Entities,
 * the {@code AggregateStorage} uses an intermediate {@link EntityRecordStorage} by delegating
 * all state-related operations to it.
 *
 * @param <I>
 *         the type of IDs of aggregates served by this storage
 * @param <S>
 *         the type of states of aggregates served by this storage
