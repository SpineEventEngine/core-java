//   - Change the logic in the event applier, so that a runtime error is not produced for the given
//     event.
//   - Manually change the event in the database. Note that the erroneous event may have been
//     propagated to other entities. Re-writing part of the system's history might lead to
//     inconsistent data.
//   - Manually delete the event in the database. Just like the previous approach, this is
//     a dangerous operation as the consequences of changing the history are unpredictable.
