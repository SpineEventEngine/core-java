/**
 * A policy converts one event into zero to many other events.
 *
 * As a rule of thumb, a policy should read:
 * Whenever <something happens>, then <something else must happen>.
 *
 * For example:
 * Whenever a field option is discovered, a validation rule must be added.
 *
 * To implement the policy, declare a method which reacts to an event with an event:
 * ```kotlin
 * class MyPolicy : Policy<ProjectCreated>() {
 *
 *     @React
 *     override fun whenever(event: ProjectCreated): Just<ReadmeFileAdded> {
 *         // Produce the event.
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * @param E the type of the event handled by this policy
