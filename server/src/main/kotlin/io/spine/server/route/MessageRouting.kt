/**
 * An abstract base for classes implementing routing schemas for [routable][Routable] messages
 * such as commands, events, rejections, or entity states.
 *
 * Routing schemas are used by [repositories][io.spine.server.entity.Repository] for delivering
 * messages to entities. The identifiers of the target entities are calculated by these schemas.
 *
 * A routing schema consists of a [default route][defaultRoute] and custom routes per a message
 * class or an interface. The default route is used when none of the routing functions
 * added to the schema for a class or an interface matches the incoming message.
 *
 * ## Composing a routing schema
 * A routing schema is composed using the [route] functions:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * routing.route<MyClass1> { message, context -> ... }
 *        .route<MyClass2> { message ->  ... }
 *        .route<MyInterface> { message, context ->  ... }
 *        .route<MoreAbstractInterface> { message ->  ... }
 * ```
 * Entries for classes must come before those for interfaces.
 * Entries for more specific interfaces must be added before entries for super-interfaces of
 * the already added interface entries. There rules ensure correct routing of messages.
 * If these rules are not followed, `IllegalStateException` will be thrown when calling
 * a [route] function which attempts to add a violating entry.
 *
 * ## Optional `context` parameter
 *
 * A routing function may accept two parameters `message` and `context`, or only
 * single `message` parameter, if the message context does not participate in the routing.
 *
 * ## Replacing the default route
 *
 * Repositories create [MessageRouting] instances for their needs providing default routes
 * that match the nature of the dispatched messages. An alternative default route can be set
 * using the [replaceDefault] function.
 *
 * @param I The type of identifiers used in the routing.
 * @param M The common supertype of messages to route.
 * @param C The type of message context.
 * @param R The type returned by a [routing function][RouteFn.invoke].
 *   For unicast routing it would be the same as [I], and `Set<I>` for multicast routing.
 * @param S The type of message routing for covariance in return types.
 * @property defaultRoute The route to be used if there is no matching entry set in [routes].
