/**
 * A [routing schema][MessageRouting] for events.
 *
 * Events are typically delivered to multiple entities,
 * following the [multicast][Multicast] strategy.
 * The `EventRouting` schema contains entries that implement the [EventRoute] interface,
 * a functional type that returns a set of entity identifiers of type [I].
 *
 * Routing functions for events can also follow a [unicast][Unicast] strategy,
 * where an event is routed to a single entity.
 * Such routes can be added using [unicast] functions.
 * These functions adapt their arguments to the [EventRoute] interface.
 *
 * ## Default event route
 *
 * By default, the `EventRouting` schema uses the producer's ID from
 * the [EventContext][EventContext.getProducerId] to determine the route.
 * This behavior is specified when `EventRouting` is [created][withDefaultByProducerId]
 * by a repository.
 *
 * To override the default routing, use [replaceDefault] in
 * the `setupCommandRouting` method of the corresponding repository class.
 * One option for an alternative default route is [EventRoute.byFirstMessageField].
 *
 * ## Adding custom routes
 *
 * Custom routes can be added using [route] functions that accept [EventRoute] implementations.
 * If an event should be routed to a single entity taking the event message or its context,
 * use the [unicast] functions.
 *
 * ## Routing events with a common interface
 *
 * Routing entries can be defined for both specific event classes and interfaces.
 * If you need to route events for both classes and their implemented interfaces,
 * define interface routes *after* entries for specific classes:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * routing.route<MyEventClass> { event, context -> ... }
 *        .route<AnotherEvent> { event -> ... }
 *        .route<MyInterface> { event, context -> ... }
 *        .route<MySuperInterface> { event -> ... }
 * ```
 *
 * Additionally, define entries for interfaces starting with more specific interfaces before
 * their super-interfaces. If this order is not followed, calling [route] or [unicast] will
 * result in an `IllegalStateException`.
 *
 * @param I The type of entity IDs to which events are routed.
 * @param defaultRoute The fallback route to use when no custom route is provided
 *   via [route] or [invoke].
