/**
 * A [routing schema][MessageRouting] designed for delivering entity state updates.
 *
 * ## Purpose of routing entity states
 *
 * Entities sometimes require updates based on the state of other entities. For instance,
 * a summary report might need to aggregate information from several detailed reports.
 * While subscribing to the same events as those used for detailed reports is an option,
 * it often results in duplicated or near-identical code.
 *
 * A more efficient approach is to [subscribe][io.spine.core.Subscribe] to messages
 * that are subclasses of [EntityState].
 *
 * ## Default routing behavior
 *
 * By default, the entity state route selects the value of the first field whose type matches
 * the type parameter [I] of the target entities. This behavior can be customized by using the
 * [replaceDefault] function.
 *
 * ## Defining custom routes
 *
 * Like [EventRouting], entity state routes support [multicast][Multicast] delivery.
 * Custom routes that deliver an entity state to multiple entities can be defined using the
 * [route] functions, which accept implementations of the [StateUpdateRoute] functional interface.
 *
 * For cases where an entity state should be routed to a single target, use the [unicast] functions.
 *
 * @param I The type of entity IDs to which updates are routed.
 * @param idClass The class of entity identifiers to which entity states are routed.
