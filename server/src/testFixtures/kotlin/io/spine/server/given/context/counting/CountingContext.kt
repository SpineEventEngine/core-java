/**
 * The Counting context generates random numbers in a range and accumulates
 * statistics in [RangeStatsView] and [NumberStatsView] projects.
 *
 * The numbers are generated in response to [GenerateNumbers] command, which is
 * handled by [RandomNumberGenerator].
 *
 * This context is a test fixture for [io.spine.server.query.QueryingClientSpec].
 *
 * ### Implementation note
 *
 * The implementation of this context is deliberately na√Øve in terms of event generation
 * and propagation. It generates many small events for each generated figure.
 *
 * If a number of events is big, it leads to an increased load to a data storage because we need to
 * load and store corresponding entity states. It is not noticeable for this test fixture
 * arrangement because in-memory storage is used.
 *
 * A production implementation of similar cases should prefer a bigger event containing
 * all information (provided [size limit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34186672) is met),
 * or the series of events containing chunks of information.
