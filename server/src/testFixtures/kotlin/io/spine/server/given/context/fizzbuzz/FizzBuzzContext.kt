 * This process manager handles the [QualifyNumber] command and the [NumberQualified] event
 * which it produces in response to the command.
 *
 * Even though qualifying the numbers is based on the [Qualifier] enum type, the ID of
 * this process manager is of the type `String` because Spine does not support
 * enum-based IDs at the time of writing. So, we use the names of the enum items as IDs.
 *
 * The routing function [qualify] calculates the ID in for the [QualifyNumber] command
 * using the rules of the [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) game.
 *
 * The [NumberQualified] event is routed by the [routeEvent] static method.
 *
 * The process manager remembers the number in its state so that the tests can check it
 * assuming successful dispatching of commands and events.
