/**
 * Creates a toy context which generates geometric figures in response to
 * the [GenerateFigures] command.
 *
 * Figures are accumulated by buckets by the [SorterView] projection.
 * Statistics for figures are handled by [FigureStatsView].
 *
 * ### Implementation note
 *
 * The implementation of this context is deliberately naïve in terms of event generation
 * and propagation. It generates an event for each generated figure.
 *
 * If a number of events is big, it leads to an increased load to a data storage because
 * we need to load and store corresponding entity states.
 * It is not noticeable for this test fixture arrangement because in-memory storage is used.
 *
 * A production implementation of similar cases should prefer a bigger event containing
 * all information (provided [size limit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34186672) is met),
 * or a series of events containing chunks of information.
 *
