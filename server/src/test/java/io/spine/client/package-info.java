/**
 * This package contains of high-level {@link io.spine.client.Client} API. For the tests of
 * low-level client API based on {@link io.spine.client.ActorRequestFactory} please see the same
 * package in the {@link ":client"} module.
 *
 * <p>High-level Client API tests are placed under the {@code ":server"} module because they
 * are based on client-server communications that in turn require backend classes
 * like {@link io.spine.server.Server} or {@link io.spine.server.BoundedContextBuilder}.
 * The {@code ":server"} module itself also depends on {@code ":client"}. Placing these client
 * tests here avoids dependency from {@code "testImplementation"} of {@code ":client"}
 * to {@code ":server"}, which is not circular but in some cases is not handled by Gradle.
