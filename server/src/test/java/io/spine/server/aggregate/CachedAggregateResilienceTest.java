/**
 * Tests how <i>cached</i> {@code Aggregate} handles the case when one of events,
 * emitted by a command, corrupts the {@code Aggregate}'s state.
 *
 * An {@code Aggregate} is cached when multiple messages are dispatched from `Inbox` at once.
 * Under the hood, they are processed as a "batch", which triggers the aggregate
 * to be cached for their processing.
 *
 * This class uses the custom {@linkplain PreparedInboxStorage InboxStorage} which allow
 * writing messages there directly. This storage is "fed" to the delivery which then is triggered
 * to perform dispatching.
